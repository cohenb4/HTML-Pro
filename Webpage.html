<p>My name is Brendan and I'm originally from New Albany, Ohio. My major is Information Systems and a minor in Computer Science. So far with work experience, I will be a Risk Advisory intern at Grant Thornton this summer (cut from 10 weeks to 2 weeks). After graduation I will hopefully go to graduate school and get either an MBA or MIS.</p>
